# A Textbook Remedy for Domain Shifts: Knowledge Priors for Medical Image Analysis

This repository contains our **re-implementation and extension** of the *Knowledge-Enhanced Bottleneck (KnoBo)* framework for **robust and interpretable medical image analysis under domain shift**.

The project demonstrates how **explicit medical knowledge**, **concept bottlenecks**, and **structured priors** significantly improve **out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization** compared to black-box deep learning models.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Deep learning models achieve high accuracy on in-domain medical imaging tasks but often **fail catastrophically under domain shift**, caused by:
- Demographic differences (age, sex, race)
- Hospital and scanner variations
- Acquisition protocols and artifacts

To address this, we build upon **KnoBo**, a **knowledge-guided concept bottleneck model**, and introduce:

- 🔍 **Medical concept bottlenecks** grounded in textbooks and PubMed
- 🧠 **Knowledge-based parameter priors**
- 👁️ **Spatial & channel attention mechanisms**
- 🎯 **Robust preprocessing (CLAHE) and augmentation**
- ⚙️ **Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization**

We evaluate the approach across **20 datasets** covering:
- **Chest X-rays**
- **Skin lesion images**
- **Confounded & unconfounded distributions**

---

## 🧠 Key Contributions

✔ Reproduced KnoBo results with strong alignment to the original paper  
✔ Achieved **20%+ improvement in OOD accuracy** over ViT and DenseNet baselines  
✔ Reduced **domain gap by ~41.8%** on chest X-ray tasks  
✔ Added **attention mechanisms** for better clinical focus  
✔ Preserved **interpretability via concept-level reasoning**

## 🏗️ Architecture

The model consists of three core components:

1. **Structure Prior**
   - Retrieval-augmented medical concepts generated from:
     - PubMed
     - Medical textbooks
     - Clinical resources
   - Concepts include:
     - Ground-glass opacity
     - Lesion asymmetry
     - Border irregularity
     - Trachea deviation

2. **Concept Bottleneck Predictor**
   - Maps images → interpretable clinical concepts
   - Concepts are predicted using weak supervision from reports/captions

3. **Parameter Prior**
   - Enforces medically meaningful concept–label relationships
   - Regularizes classifier weights using knowledge-based sign constraints

📌 **Enhanced Architecture**
- Added **spatial + channel attention**
- Integrated **CLAHE preprocessing**
- Strong data augmentation pipeline
